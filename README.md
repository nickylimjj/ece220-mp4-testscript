# ece220-sp16-testscripts
A collection of Makefiles and testscripts I wrote for ece 220 spring 2016. 

Instructions:
1) git clone https://www.github.com/nickylimjj/ece220-sp16-testscripts.git
2) move the respective files into your working folder.
 ie) files in mp4 folder into mp4.
3) run `make` to compile the files

You can also run `make clean` to remove all the dependencies.

Have fun!
