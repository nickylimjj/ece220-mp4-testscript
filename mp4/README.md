# ece220-mp4-testscript
A Make file and test script I wrote for ece 220 spring 2016 MP4: Polynomial Root Finding.

Instructions:
1) git clone https://www.github.com/nickylimjj/ece220-mp4-testscript.git
2) move the files into your mp4 folder.
3) run `make` to compile the files
4) run `make test` to test it alongside the eval.sh

You can also run `make clean` to remove all the dependencies.

Have fun!
